An example with a fish below. https://github.com/soprof/ML_playground\r\nIt somehow works already, needs a better training data(I only used it the heroes avatars and duplicated them 30 times), was thinking to parse some website with hero wallpapers for better data.\r\nFeel free to email/pm me if you are believe it’s fun or you want to contribute.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/lLTHJ7E.png\r\n![fish](http://i.imgur.com/lLTHJ7E.png)",
